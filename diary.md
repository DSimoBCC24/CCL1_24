14/1/25 I was trying to decide if I'm going to implement jump and run Biota or top view, where biota is runnning and you need to changge the direction in order to avoid toxins (enemy). I implementet 3 game objects (main player, collectives and enemies). I had difficulities with the velocity. Tomorrow I'm going to find out how I can randomly pop up the nutrients, that Biota needs to collect.

15/1/25 Today I implemented score and the functionality of it. So when Biota is collecting the nutrients, the broccoli disapear and the score increse by 10 points after each element. I also implement the border of the game and add enemy to it. Tomorrow I want to make collision Biota vs enemy and add the start and end screen.

16/1/25 The chalange of today was making random appearance of enemy (toxins). I figuared out after reasearch and add colision with biota. Tomorrow I want to code update of the health bar. When Biota collide with toxiin health bar goes down by 25%.

17/1/25 My game is 70% playable. My focus is today set up the collision between Biota and Toxins.

20/1/25 Im trying to do the game beautiful today. I was adding 3 additional screens (intro, game won and game over)

21/1/25 I was working on spritesheets. Unfortunatelly I draw them on high resolution in procreate and now when I scale them to my dimension are pixeled.

22/1/25 I'm having difficulities, how to restart the game and implement play again button. There are still collisions after the game is won or lost.

23/1/25 I was polishing detail of the game look. I also created 1m pitch presentation document, what we had to share. I will still polish some details today. But the game is overall done! Jupiiii!!!
