#### ✍️ Reflection
What went well:
My biggest success was that I was able to make this game run and playable, since I was coding a JS game for the first time. 
I’m also happy to give this game a nice look.

Challenges:
Javascript, overall was my biggest difficulty. OOP is not easy at all, in order to understand what each code-line is doing and where is it placed.
I’ve got help from my classmates and WEB/AI.
